# Challenge_100_days_learning_Python
<h1 align="center">Hi guys!</h1> <br>
<h1>Today I challenged myself to learn and practice 100 days of active programming language Python!</h1><br>
<h3>1st-day, 2019-05-02</h3>
I was looking for a source for a long time to learn the language faster and more efficiently.<br>
My friend suggested the HackerRank Web Site, and I was surprised because learning a language with practice is better<br>
than just reading boring books!<bgr>
my first task was to return the word Hello World!<br>

since the beginning was too easy, I decided to continue to solve problems!<br>

And I decided to dwell on this since today I spent most of my time studying the theory and the principle of work!.

since yesterday I could not practice because of the lack of time, today I decided to continue<br>
Today in practice, I have arithmetic operators<br>

I read about arithmetic operations on the Internet and easily solved the problem.

I have not been there for a long time and could not post my work and projects to this blog.<br>
I was preparing for exams, but now I have more time and full of energy to cheerfully continue the challenge<br>
<h1>3st day, 2019-06-15</h1><br>
today I studied recursion<br>
further it becomes more and more difficult but it is very fascinating and interesting<br>
