# Challenge_100_days_learning_Python
<h1 align="center">Hi guys!</h1> <br>
<h1>Today I challenged myself to learn and practice 100 days of active programming language Python!</h1><br>
<h3>1st-day, 2019-05-02</h3>
I was looking for a source for a long time to learn the language faster and more efficiently.<br>
My friend suggested the HackerRank Web Site, and I was surprised because learning a language with practice is better<br>
than just reading boring books!<bgr>
my first task was to return the word Hello World!<br>

since the beginning was too easy, I decided to continue to solve problems!<br>

And I decided to dwell on this since today I spent most of my time studying the theory and the principle of work!.
